    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add steak and cook until browned. Add mushrooms, bell pepper, and onion; cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a slow cooker, combine beef broth, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, and red wine. Transfer steak and vegetables to the slow cooker; stir to blend. Cover and cook on High for 3 to 4 hours, or until beef is extremely tender.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Drain liquid from the slow cooker and save for dipping.</li>
        <li>Slice French bread loaf lengthwise like a submarine sandwich. Mix together horseradish and mustard; spread onto the inside of loaf. Place slices of provolone cheese on both sides of loaf, then fill with steak and vegetables. Close the loaf and wrap with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. For crunchier bread, you can bake it without the aluminum foil. Slice into 4 sandwiches; serve with the juices from the slow cooker for dipping.</li>
